Design Problem #10 from Spring 2019, CS 142

Many international travelers arrive at JFK International Airport each day.

They can be foreign nationals or US citizens.

In order to go through customs and enter the US, there are certain qualities that they need to attain.

For example, foreign nationals must have a valid US Visa, and have either clean background, or have committed a minor crime (misdemeanour?) that has already been explained.

Both US citizens and foreign nationals need to not be bringing unknown substances or things that are prohibited into the country.

If any of these qualities aren’t met, the particular visitor won’t be able to enter the US.

Design a system for the authorities to use to store information on travelers and to quickly look them up upon arrival.
